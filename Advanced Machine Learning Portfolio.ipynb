The dataset has contain data of images that indicate 3 situations: COVID, NORMAL, and PNEUMONIA. By using models like transfer learning model and neural network, the predictive accuracy could be improved. Therefore, not only scientists or doctors can benefit from it for this research, the entire society can also benefit from it for knowing the disease better and having better treatment. \n",
